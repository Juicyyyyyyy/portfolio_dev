However, don't over-normalize as it can impact performance.\n\n## Indexing\n\nCreate indexes on columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses.\n\n## Relationships\n\nUse foreign keys to establish relationships between tables and maintain referential integrity.\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\nUse consistent naming conventions for tables, columns, and constraints to make your schema more readable and maintainable.",
