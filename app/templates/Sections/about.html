                    I'm studying Software Engineering at EPITA Paris, and I'm currently in my third year. I'm passionate about many computer-related domains as well as other fields, such as productivity optimization, finance (investment/trading), Linux configuration, and software design.

                    I love building projects and aim to turn every idea of mine into reality. I have built SaaS applications, trading algorithms, trading indicators, Linux configurations, scripts, web apps, and finance tools. The vast majority of my projects are open source, and you can find them all on my <a href="https://github.com/Juicyyyyyyy" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>.
