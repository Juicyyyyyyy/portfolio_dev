		description="""This desktop app is developed using the **CustomTkinter Python framework** for the frontend and **Python** for the backend. I also utilized the Python library '**PyPortfolioOpt**', which aided in performing many complex mathematical calculations. 

The app's logic is grounded in several famous and internationally recognized financial and mathematical theories. The most notable is the '**Modern Portfolio Theory**' (MPT), developed in 1952 by Nobel Prize-winning financial expert **Harry Markowitz**. MPT is an investment theory that enables investors to construct an asset portfolio maximizing expected return for a given level of risk. 

Another key model is the **Black-Litterman model**, which extends modern portfolio theory by incorporating investor views of expected returns. Lastly, the **Monte Carlo simulation** is used, a method for modeling future outcomes by generating random possibilities based on specific assumptions.

To use the app, you will need to choose between manually entering each asset in the portfolio or generating a portfolio of assets using AI (**GPT-3.5**). Then, select a start date and an end date, as the app will fetch price data for this period. You must also choose the financial model you wish to use: **MPT**, **Black-Litterman**, or **Monte Carlo**. 

After filling in all parameters, click on '**continue**'. You will be directed to a page depending on the chosen model. Here, you'll need to select additional parameters before obtaining your results.
